     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Your choice of toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of toppings evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the pizza and sprinkle with dried oregano.</li>
        <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone. If using a baking sheet, place it directly in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
